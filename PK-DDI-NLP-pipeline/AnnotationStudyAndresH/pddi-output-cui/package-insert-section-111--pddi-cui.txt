Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is coadministered with nifedipine and dose reduction of nifedipine considered.  		49276	49276
doxazosin	Doxazosin	3	1	true	positive	Doxazosin:  Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Coadministration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively.  In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively.  Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin.  		49276	49276
