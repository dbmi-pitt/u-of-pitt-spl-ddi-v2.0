nifedipine	Nifedipine	1	1	false	none	Nifedipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator which acts directly on vascular smooth muscle.  		D009543	D009543
nifedipine	Nifedipine	1	2	false	none	Nifedipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator which acts directly on vascular smooth muscle.  The binding of nifedipine to voltage-dependent and possibly receptor-operated channels in vascular smooth muscle results in an inhibition of calcium influx through these channels.  		D009543	D009543

nifedipine	Nifedipine	2	4	false	none	The binding of nifedipine to voltage-dependent and possibly receptor-operated channels in vascular smooth muscle results in an inhibition of calcium influx through these channels.  Stores of intracellular calcium in vascular smooth muscle are limited and thus dependent upon the influx of extracellular calcium for contraction to occur.  The reduction in calcium influx by nifedipine causes arterial vasodilation and decreased peripheral vascular resistance which results in reduced arterial blood pressure.  		D009543	D009543
