ibuprofen	ampicillin	92	90	false	none	12.5 Drug-Drug Interactions    It is theoretically possible that lansoprazole may interfere with the absorption of other drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, iron salts, digoxin).  Lansoprazole is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system, specifically through the CYP3A and CYP2C19 isozymes.
