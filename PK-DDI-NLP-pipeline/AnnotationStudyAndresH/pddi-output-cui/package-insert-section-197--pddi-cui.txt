zidovudine	Ribavirin	60	59	true	positive	Ribavirin has been found to inhibit the phosphorylation of zidovudine in cell culture.  Resistance:  Genotypic analyses of the isolates selected in cell culture and recovered from zidovudine-treated patients showed mutations in the HIV-1 RT gene resulting in 6 amino acid substitutions (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y or F, and K219Q) that confer zidovudine resistance.  		11413	none	11413	none
