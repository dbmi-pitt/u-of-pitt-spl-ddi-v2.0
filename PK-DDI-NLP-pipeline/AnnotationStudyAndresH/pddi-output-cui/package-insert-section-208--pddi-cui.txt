Clopidogrel	clopidogrel	3	1	false	none	12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY    12.1 Mechanism of Action    Clopidogrel is an inhibitor of platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets.  12.2 Pharmacodynamics    Clopidogrel must be metabolized by CYP450 enzymes to produce the active metabolite that inhibits platelet aggregation.  The active metabolite of clopidogrel selectively inhibits the binding of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to its platelet P2Y12 receptor and the subsequent ADP-mediated activation of the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation.
