Antiretroviral Agents    Concomitant use of atazanavir and proton pump inhibitors is not recommended.  Co-administration of atazanavir with proton pump inhibitors is expected to substantially decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations and thereby reduce its therapeutic effect.  		121243	343047	121243	343047
voriconazole	atazanavir	12	14	true	positive	When voriconazole (400 mg Q12h x 1 day, then 200 mg x 6 days) was given with omeprazole (40 mg once daily x 7 days) to healthy subjects, it significantly increased the steady-state Cmax and AUC0-24 of omeprazole, an average of 2 times (90% CI: 1.8, 2.6) and 4 times (90% CI: 3.3, 4.4) respectively as compared to when omeprazole was given without voriconazole.

voriconazole	p450	9	7	true	positive	Although in normal subjects no interaction with theophylline or propranolol was found, there have been clinical reports of interaction with other drugs metabolized via the cytochrome P450 system (e.g., cyclosporine, disulfiram, benzodiazepines).  Patients should be monitored to determine if it is necessary to adjust the dosage of these drugs when taken concomitantly with omeprazole delayed-release capsules USP.  Concomitant administration of omeprazole and voriconazole (a combined inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4) resulted in more than doubling of the omeprazole exposure.  		121243	none	121243	none

ampicillin	p450	1	3	true	positive	7 DRUG INTERACTIONS    Drugs for which gastric pH can affect bioavailability    Because of its profound and long lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion, it is theoretically possible that omeprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts).  In the clinical trials, antacids were used concomitantly with the administration of omeprazole delayed-release capsules USP.  Drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP)    Omeprazole can prolong the elimination of diazepam, warfarin and phenytoin, drugs that are metabolized by oxidation in the liver.  		733	none	733	none
