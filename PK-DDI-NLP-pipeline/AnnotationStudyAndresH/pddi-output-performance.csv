195	isoproterenol	propafenone	7	5	true	positive	Propafenone reduces spontaneous automaticity and depresses triggered activity.  Studies in anesthetized dogs and isolated organ preparations show that propafenone has beta-sympatholytic activity at about 1/50 the potency of propranolol.  Clinical studies employing isoproterenol challenge and exercise testing after single doses of propafenone indicate a beta-adrenergic blocking potency (per mg) about 1/40 that of propranolol in man.	6054	8754
195	propafenone	procaine	9	11	true	positive	At very high concentrations in vitro, propafenone can inhibit the slow inward current carried by calcium, but this calcium antagonist effect probably does not contribute to antiarrhythmic efficacy.  Moreover, propafenone inhibits a variety of cardiac potassium currents in in vitro studies (i.e. the transient outward, the delayed rectifier, and the inward rectifier current).  Propafenone has local anesthetic activity approximately equal to procaine.	8754	8701

74	voriconazole	p450	9	7	true	positive	Although in normal subjects no interaction with theophylline or propranolol was found, there have been clinical reports of interaction with other drugs metabolized via the cytochrome P450 system (e.g., cyclosporine, disulfiram, benzodiazepines).  Patients should be monitored to determine if it is necessary to adjust the dosage of these drugs when taken concomitantly with omeprazole delayed-release capsules USP.  Concomitant administration of omeprazole and voriconazole (a combined inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4) resulted in more than doubling of the omeprazole exposure.	121243	
74	warfarin	ampicillin	3	1	true	positive	7 DRUG INTERACTIONS    Drugs for which gastric pH can affect bioavailability    Because of its profound and long lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion, it is theoretically possible that omeprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts).  In the clinical trials, antacids were used concomitantly with the administration of omeprazole delayed-release capsules USP.  Drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP)    Omeprazole can prolong the elimination of diazepam, warfarin and phenytoin, drugs that are metabolized by oxidation in the liver.	11289	733

77	citalopram	digoxin	1	1	true	negative	In subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin.	2556	3407
186	cyclosporine	creatinine	21	20	true	positive	Kinetic studies with another statin, having a similar principal route of elimination, have suggested that for a given dose level higher systemic exposure may be achieved in patients with severe renal insufficiency (as measured by creatinine clearance).  Although the mechanism is not fully understood, cyclosporine has been shown to increase the AUC of statins.	3008	
186	cyclosporine	simvastatin	21	22	true	positive	Although the mechanism is not fully understood, cyclosporine has been shown to increase the AUC of statins.  The increase in AUC for simvastatin acid is presumably due, in part, to inhibition of CYP3A4.	3008	36567
133	mesoridazine	propranolol	1	1	true	positive	Co-administration of long-acting propranolol at doses greater than or equal to 160 mg/day resulted in increased thioridazine plasma concentrations ranging from 55% to 369% and increased thioridazine metabolite (mesoridazine) concentrations ranging from 33% to 209%.	6779	8787
133	thioridazine	mesoridazine	1	1	true	positive	Co-administration of long-acting propranolol at doses greater than or equal to 160 mg/day resulted in increased thioridazine plasma concentrations ranging from 55% to 369% and increased thioridazine metabolite (mesoridazine) concentrations ranging from 33% to 209%.	10502	6779
133	thioridazine	propranolol	1	1	true	positive	Co-administration of long-acting propranolol at doses greater than or equal to 160 mg/day resulted in increased thioridazine plasma concentrations ranging from 55% to 369% and increased thioridazine metabolite (mesoridazine) concentrations ranging from 33% to 209%.	10502	8787
