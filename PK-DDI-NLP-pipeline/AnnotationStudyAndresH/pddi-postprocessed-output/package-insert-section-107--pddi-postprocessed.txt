epinephrine	metoprolol	9	7	false	none	Metoprolol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and membrane-stabilizing activity is detectable only at plasma concentrations much greater than required for beta-blockade.  Animal and human experiments indicate that metoprolol slows the sinus rate and decreases AV nodal conduction.  The relative beta1-selectivity of metoprolol has been confirmed by the following: (1) In normal subjects, metoprolol is unable to reverse the beta2-mediated vasodilating effects of epinephrine.  		3992	6918	D004837	D008790
