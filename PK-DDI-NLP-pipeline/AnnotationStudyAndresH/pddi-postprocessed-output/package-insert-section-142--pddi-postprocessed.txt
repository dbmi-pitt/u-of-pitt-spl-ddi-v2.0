serotonin	Amlodipine	10	8	false	none	Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.  The precise mechanisms by which amlodipine relieves angina have not been fully delineated, but are thought to include the following:     Exertional Angina: In patients with exertional angina, amlodipine besylate reduces the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works and reduces the rate pressure product, and thus myocardial oxygen demand, at any given level of exercise.  Vasospastic Angina: Amlodipine besylate has been demonstrated to block constriction and restore blood flow in coronary arteries and arterioles in response to calcium, potassium epinephrine, serotonin, and thromboxane A2 analog in experimental animal models and in human coronary vessels in vitro.  		1311214	17767	D012701	D017311

The precise mechanisms by which amlodipine relieves angina have not been fully delineated, but are thought to include the following:     Exertional Angina: In patients with exertional angina, amlodipine besylate reduces the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works and reduces the rate pressure product, and thus myocardial oxygen demand, at any given level of exercise.  Vasospastic Angina: Amlodipine besylate has been demonstrated to block constriction and restore blood flow in coronary arteries and arterioles in response to calcium, potassium epinephrine, serotonin, and thromboxane A2 analog in experimental animal models and in human coronary vessels in vitro.  		17767	3992	D017311	D004837

The precise mechanisms by which amlodipine relieves angina have not been fully delineated, but are thought to include the following:     Exertional Angina: In patients with exertional angina, amlodipine besylate reduces the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works and reduces the rate pressure product, and thus myocardial oxygen demand, at any given level of exercise.
