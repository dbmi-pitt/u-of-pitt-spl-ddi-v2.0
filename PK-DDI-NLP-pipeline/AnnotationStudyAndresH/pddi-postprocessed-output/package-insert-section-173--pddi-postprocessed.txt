Extent of absorption increases in proportion to LIPITOR dose.  The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14% and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30%.  		0	83367	153165	C065179

LIPITOR	atorvastatin	28	26	false	none	The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14% and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30%.  The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa and/or hepatic first-pass metabolism.  Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25% and 9%, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDL-C reduction is similar whether LIPITOR is given with or without food.  		0	83367	153165	C065179

LIPITOR	p450	36	38	false	none	In vitro inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of LIPITOR.  Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites.

In animals, the ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation.  Excretion: LIPITOR and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic and/or extra-hepatic metabolism; however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation.  		0	none	153165	none
