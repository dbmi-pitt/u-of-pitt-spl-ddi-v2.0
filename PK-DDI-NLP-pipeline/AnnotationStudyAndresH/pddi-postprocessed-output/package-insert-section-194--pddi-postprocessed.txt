propafenone	metoprolol	26	24	true	negative	In 4 patients, administration of metoprolol with propafenone increased the metoprolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 100-400%.  The pharmacokinetics of propafenone was not affected by the coadministration of either propranolol or metoprolol.  In clinical trials using propafenone immediate release tablets, patients who were receiving beta-blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects.  		8754	6918	D011405	D008790

Quinidine	rifampin	10	12	false	none	A 100 mg dose of quinidine increased steady state concentrations of propafenone 3-fold.  Avoid concomitant use of propafenone and quinidine.  Rifampin    Concomitant administration of rifampin and propafenone in extensive metabolizers decreased the plasma concentrations of propafenone by 67% with a corresponding decrease of 5OH-propafenone by 65%.  		9068	9384	9068	9384

Quinidine	Cimetidine	7	5	true	positive	Cimetidine    Concomitant administration of propafenone immediate release tablets and cimetidine in 12 healthy subjects resulted in a 20% increase in steady-state plasma concentrations of propafenone.  Fluoxetine    Concomitant administration of propafenone and fluoxetine in extensive metabolizers increased the S propafenone Cmax and AUC by 39 and 50% and the R propafenone Cmax and AUC by 71 and 50%.  Quinidine    Small doses of quinidine completely inhibit the CYP2D6 hydroxylation metabolic pathway, making all patients, in effect, slow metabolizers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)].  		9068	2541	9068	2541
