fluconazole	zidovudine	4	2	true	positive	There was a significant increase in zidovudine AUC following the administration of fluconazole.  The mean ± SD increase in AUC was 20% ± 32% (range: -27 to 104%).  The metabolite, GZDV, to parent drug ratio significantly decreased after the administration of fluconazole, from 7.6 ± 3.6 to 5.7 ± 2.2.  		4450	11413	4450	D015215
