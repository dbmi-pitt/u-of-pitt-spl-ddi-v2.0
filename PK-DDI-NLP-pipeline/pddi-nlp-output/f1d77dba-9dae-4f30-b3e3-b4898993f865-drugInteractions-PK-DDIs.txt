A similar reduction in antiplatelet activity was observed with esomeprazole when given concomitantly with Plavix.  Consider using another acid-reducing agent with minimal or no CYP2C19 inhibitory effect on the formation of clopidogrel active metabolite.

omeprazole	Clopidogrel	10	9	false	none	Consider using another acid-reducing agent with minimal or no CYP2C19 inhibitory effect on the formation of clopidogrel active metabolite.  Dexlansoprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole had less effect on the antiplatelet activity of Plavix than did omeprazole or esomeprazole [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  	
omeprazole	Clopidogrel	10	12	false	none	Dexlansoprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole had less effect on the antiplatelet activity of Plavix than did omeprazole or esomeprazole [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  7.2   Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)                                                 Coadministration of Plavix and NSAIDs increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.  7.3   Warfarin (CYP2C9 Substrates)                                                  Although the administration of clopidogrel 75 mg per day did not modify the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) or INR in patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, coadministration of Plavix with warfarin increases the risk of bleeding because of independent effects on hemostasis.
