In clinical studies, omeprazole was shown to reduce the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel bisulfate when given concomitantly or 12 hours apart.  A higher dose regimen of clopidogrel concomitantly administered with omeprazole increases antiplatelet response; an appropriate dose regimen has not been established.
