INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Unzip the PDDI classifier to a convenient folder and write the path to the '1.0' subfolder into pddiextractor.properties

2. Edit the paths to the various models referred to in etc/clearparser-lib/config/config_dep_en.xml to fit your local environment

3. Run (NOTE: server will run on port 12341. If necessary, you can
change the port in SPL_PDDI_NLP_Endpoint.java. The port will change
since the run target recompiles all source code):
