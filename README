A script pipeline to run the SPL drug NER and PK PDDI NLP

Authors: Richard D Boyce, Peter Randall, Greg Gardner

------------------------------------------------------------
DEPENDENCIES
------------------------------------------------------------
* u-of-pitt-SPL-drug-NER : available from <https://swat-4-med-safety.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/u-of-pitt-SPL-drug-NER>. Be sure to configure the 'dictionary_path' variable in etc/file_properties.xml so the the path to the WordNet dictionary resolves correctly

* SPL-PDDI-NLP-server : available from <https://swat-4-med-safety.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/u-of-pitt-spl-ddi-v2.0/PK-DDI-webapp/SPL-PDDI-NLP-server>. Be sure to read the README in that project's folder and configure for your site

* SPL-PDDI-NLP-client : available from <https://swat-4-med-safety.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/u-of-pitt-spl-ddi-v2.0/PK-DDI-webapp/SPL-PDDI-NLP-client>. The client requires Python 2.7, simplejson, and the Python Suds SOAP client.

------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------
1) configure the paths at the top of pipeline.sh

2) write the setids for the SPLs to process in the setIDs.txt file
(NOTE: currently, the pipeline only the processes the "Drug
Interactions" section of an SPL. It can easily be extended to other
sections by editing the code in retrieveSPLSquery.py. For example, you
could call getAllSPLSectionsSparql or write a new method that selects
a custom set of sections.)

3) make sure that SPL-PDDI-NLP-server is running (see the README in
that project's folder)

3) run the pipeline as follows:
$ ./pipeline.sh
